# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct was taken and adapted from the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct).

## Be considerate

Our work will be used and seen by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.

## Be respectful

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We donâ€™t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

## Take responsibility for our words and our actions

We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.

## Be collaborative

What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between users that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole. Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Be honest in your contributions.

## Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus

Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction. We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to an internal group discussion and involve external entities where appropriate.

## Ask for help when unsure

Nobody is expected to be perfect in this group. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

## Take a break considerately

When somebody temporarily disengages or cannot do assigned taks for the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people about the situation and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off, while still contributing appropriately.
