- **Description**:

Design and play your own version of modernized Yahtzee

This project creates an online multiplayer game platform that allows for the creation of custom Yahtzee-like games and variants. This family of games will come with some presets such as classic Yahtzee, and custom tested variants, but will allow for the users to set their own variables such as number of dice, what kind of dice, and some elements of scoring, and then play that game. Kinds of dice would include cubes and octahedrons, among other multi-sided dice, and scoring could be calculated at the end of the game, as in classic Yahtzee, or on a per-round basis, where hands go in a head-to-head matchup. More customization options will be added as per game testing and seeing what is fun and interesting.
