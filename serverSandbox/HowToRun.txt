How to Start Instance
1) Start Amazon EC2 Instance (which is preloaded with the server implementation)
2) In terminal, ssh into the amazon linux server using the following command
ssh -i "path to .pem file" ec2-user@"insert public DNS from instance details"
example:
ssh -i C:\Users\nigel\OneDrive\Desktop\Nigel\GameDev\AWS\duel-of-the-eights-server-key-pair.pem ec2-user@"insert public DNS from instance details"
3) Execute server file using the following command
./"path to .sh server executable"
example:
./LinuxServer/ServerSandbox.sh
3.5) If at this point you run into a permissions denied error, use the following command, then try step 3 again
chmod +x "Folder path"/*
example:
chmod +x LinuxServer/*
**ls -latr to check
4) Update the default ip with the public DNS from the EC2 Server in the client game

How to stop instance
1) If ssh'd into linux server and you have the server running directly from the terminal, use CTRL+C to stop the server implementation from running
2) Use the exit Command to leave the ssh remote terminal
3) Stop the instance on Amazon EC2 portal


Optional (To run server in backend, without having the terminal window open):
1) Start Amazon EC2 Instance (which is preloaded with the server implementation)
2) In terminal, ssh into the amazon linux server using the following command
ssh -i "path to .pem file" ec2-user@"insert public DNS from instance details"
example:
ssh -i C:\Users\nigel\OneDrive\Desktop\Nigel\GameDev\AWS\duel-of-the-eights-server-key-pair.pem ec2-user@"insert public DNS from instance details"
3) To check running processes use the following command (there should be none)
ps -A | grep "Server Build Name"
example:
ps -A | grep ServerSandbox
4) Execute server file using the following modified command
./"path to .sh server executable" &
example:
./LinuxServer/ServerSandbox.sh &
5) Use the exit command to leave the linux terminal (The game server should still be running in the background)

How to stop instance (When Server is running in the background)
1) In terminal, ssh into the amazon linux server using the following command
ssh -i "path to .pem file" ec2-user@"insert public DNS from instance details"
example:
ssh -i C:\Users\nigel\OneDrive\Desktop\Nigel\GameDev\AWS\duel-of-the-eights-server-key-pair.pem ec2-user@"insert public DNS from instance details"
2) To check running processes use the following command (there should be two)
ps -A | grep "Server Build Name"
example:
ps -A | grep ServerSandbox
3) Use the following command
kill "PID"
example:
kill 3046
4) repeat setps 3 and 4 until all processes are gone
5) Use the exit command to lve the linux terminal
6) Stop the instance on Amazon EC2 portal


How to upload Linux Server files
1) In terminal, scp the files to the server using the following command
scp -i "path to .pem file" -r "path to LinuxServer folder on local machine" ec2-user@"insert public DNS from instance details":~/.
