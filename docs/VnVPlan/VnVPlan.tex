\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

This project creates an online multiplayer game platform that allows for the creation of
custom Yahtzee-like games and variants. This family of games will come with some presets
such as classic Yahtzee, an octahedron version, and more, but will allow for the
users to set their own variables such as number of dice, what kind of dice, and some elements
of scoring, and then play that game. Kinds of dice would include cubes and octahedrons,
among other multi-sided dice, and scoring could be calculated at the end of the game, as in
classic Yahtzee, or on a per-round basis, where hands go in a head-to-head matchup.

\subsection{Objectives}

\iffalse
\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}
\fi

The main objective of this project is to ensure robust and flexible functionality that supports customizability in game creation, with confidence in their interactability. Specifically, the project will focus on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Demonstrating Adequate Usability: User interactions should be intuitive, enabling smooth navigation and game setup without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
	\item Supporting User-Driven Customizability: Emphasis will be placed on making the platform adaptable, allowing users to easily create and modify games with various dice types and scoring rules. These elements must be modular such that a custom game can make use of these components in a flexible fashion.
	\item Ensuring Software Correctness: Testing will confirm accurate dice roll usage, score calculations, and game outcomes to build confidence in the correctness of the core mechanics.
\end{itemize}

Out of Scope Objectives: Due to time constraints, certain areas are out of scope for this project. These include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Probability Testing: While a statistical analysis could be done on the randomness of dice rolls, it would be out of scope for our current plans and we will proceed with a general assumption that functions that rely on random values are as accurately pseudo-random as needed, without set seeding.
	\item Performance Optimization: While performance will be monitored, extensive optimization for faulty connections or intricate rule configurations will be left out, with plans to address this in potential future releases.
\end{itemize}

This prioritization allows us to allocate resources efficiently, focusing on core functionality and foundational elements.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\iffalse
\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}
\fi

Through the implementation of not just a single Yahtzee game variant, but
by implementing a system where the user can create a custom game variant
and connect to another online player to play it, we are looking to achieve the
advanced challenge level. We would also provide some pre-set game variants
that have been tested and were found to be more fun than others.

We will include extra elements to aid in better developing our game and
allow us to design for a fun gaming experience, as we wish this game to not be
just a capstone project, but a game we can be proud of and put out into the
world. Following industry practices in game development, we wish to potentially
do the following extras:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus groups, Surveys, and Interviews
	\item Usability testing
	\item User personas
	\item User documentation
\end{itemize}

\wss{TODO update problem statement and gitlab once we know difficulty level and what extras}
%TODO update problem statement and gitlab once we know difficulty level and what extras

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\iffalse
\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}
\citet{SRS}
\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}
\fi

The following documents are crucial for the Verification and Validation process, ensuring the project meets its objectives and operates reliably:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Software Requirements Specification (SRS): This document outlines the core requirements for the platform, defining features and limitations, as well as expected behaviors. The SRS serves as a primary reference to validate that the developed software meets user and system requirements.
	\item \wss{TODO add more}
\end{itemize}

\wss{TODO add BibTeX and hyperlinks}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to come.}

\noindent This section covers the project's verification and validation (V\&V) strategy, including the methodologies and strategies used to ensure software dependability, correctness, and usability. Each component of the plan will establish verification and validation procedures appropriate for each stage of the project lifecycle, from reviewing the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to testing

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}


\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2} 
  \begin{adjustbox}{max width=0.9\textwidth} 
    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|p{2.5cm}|p{2.75cm}|X|} 
    \hline
    \textbf{Team Member} & \textbf{Role} & \textbf{Responsibilities} \\ \hline
    Member X & SRS Verification Lead & Oversees SRS review, organizes feedback, coordinates checklist compilation, and ensures any new or modified requirements are accurate. \\ \hline
    Member X & Design\newline Verification Lead & Oversees design review, develops checklists, and organizes peer review meetings regarding design. They also ensure that any design modifications that either are outcomes of meetings or decisions made within the team are properly formulated and accurate.  \\ \hline
    Member X & Implementation Tester & Performs unit tests, isolates tests for core capabilities, and ensures that individual code components are in line with the implementation plan outlined in this document. In charge of testing any new modifications and green-lighting them. \\ \hline
    Member X & Software\newline Validation Lead & In charge of ensuring that the software matches user requirements through using feedback provided by supervisor and peer reviews. Additionally, in charge of performing validation strategies outlined in the document. \\ \hline
    Member X & Tool and\newline Automation Lead & Oversees the installation and usage of automated testing tools, unit testing frameworks, and test coverage metric tracking tools. In charge of sourcing the correct tools needed for the specific system as well. \\ \hline
    Supervisor & Project\newline Reviewer & Provides oversight, participates in structured review sessions, and provides feedback on requirements, design, and implementation reviews. Due to the supervisor's area of expertise, feedback will focus on requirements and design as opposed to programming implementation advice. \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Verification and Validation Team Roles}
  \label{tab:team}
\end{table}


\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}


\noindent The SRS verification will take an organized approach, including supervisor and peer review sessions, to ensure that the stated requirements are clear, accurate, and thorough. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structured Review Meeting}: Conducted with the supervisor in person to present the essential SRS components. The team will highlight the essential functional and non-functional requirements and solicit feedback on the clarity and feasibility of each requirement. The feedback will then be tracked as issues and be used to make any modifications deemed necessary.
    \item \textbf{Checklist Creation}: A detailed checklist will be prepared to analyze each SRS item, ensuring the requirements are accurate and feasible for execution. The checklist will be utilized at each review session. If the checklist is filled out completely, the team will know that there are no necessary changes and if it is not then necessary modifications will be made to the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Peer Review Sessions}: The team will have their peers such as classmates conduct task-based inspections of the SRS to identify any ambiguities or missing components. This will ensure that the SRS is complete and viable. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\noindent To ensure that the design complies with the SRS standards, the team will conduct a structured review process including the entire team, external peers and the teams supervisor:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design Checklists}:  A checklist will be developed to guide reviewers through each design component and confirm whether or not they correspond to both the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Peer Review}: Classmates and primary reviewers will use the checklist to determine if the design is consistent with the SRS. This includes the code structure, front-end design, and game mechanics. 
    \item \textbf{Structured Review Meeting}: The team will schedule a review session with our supervisor where each design element will be presented. The goal being to receive feedback and make any necessary modifications. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\noindent The V\&V plan itself will be verified to make sure it adequately addresses every facet of the project and sufficiently plans appropriate methods of verification and validation.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mutation Testing}: To guarantee robustness of our software, we'll use mutation testing to assess how well the test cases work and to make sure that the methods used for verification can accurately detect software faults.
  \item \textbf{Review Sessions}: To ensure that all necessary verification and validation methods are covered, the V\&V plan will be reviewed by the teams peers and supervisor utilizing a checklist. The team will also independently review the methods to ensure all bases are covered.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\noindent The implementation verification will primarily focus on unit testing and manual testing, emphasizing the isolation of modules and testing them with constant inputs mimicking user inputs. Given that project is a game, testing poses unique challenges and nuances that require careful consideration.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unit Testing}: The team will employ isolated unit tests, setting fixed inputs to verify core functionalities like game logic, scoring systems, and user input handling.  Simulations of dice rolls and the scores that go along with them are one example. Additionally,  to ensure that tests only concentrate on the module's functionality and are not influenced by outside factors, mocking will be used to mimic external dependencies.
  \item \textbf{Manual Testing}: Manual testing will be used to evaluate the game from a player's point of view and make sure that gameplay is fluid, intuitive, and stimulating, manual testing will be used. In order to find any possible errors or discrepancies in the game mechanics, test cases will cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases and user interactions.
  \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs}: In order to collect feedback on code correctness, standard compliance adherence, and alignment with design specifications outlined in the SRS, team-based code walkthroughs will be carried out. These walkthroughs will be held with our peers and external individuals with expertise in the field.
  \item \textbf{Static Analysis}: FxCop, a free static code analysis tool from Microsoft, will be utilized to evaluate the code. It excels at analyzing .NET managed code assemblies for adherence to Microsoft's .NET Framework Design Guidelines. This tool will help ensure code quality and identify potential issues early in the development cycle. It is particularly well-suited for this project, as the game is being developed using C\# on the .NET version of Godot.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\noindent To maintain code quality and reliability, teh team will implement a variety of automated testing tools. Any mentioned tools are not finalized and may be substituted based on team preferences and needs:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing Framework}: The team will employ a unit testing framework, such as NUnit or xUnit, recommended by Microsoft, to automate our test cases. This will help ensure that each game feature functions consistently and accurately.
    \item \textbf{Test Coverage Tools}: The team will utilize Coverlet which provides a cross-platform code coverage framework for C\#. As part of the .NET Foundation, Coverlet is recommended by Microsoft and will help us track coverage metrics to ensure our tests sufficiently cover the core components of the system.
    \item \textbf{Linters}: The team will integrate language-specific linters, like Roslyn analyzers recommended by Microsoft, to ensure our code adheres to best practices and established coding standards.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI)}: The team will try to use a continuous integration platform, such GitHub Actions. However, the unique demands of game development could make it difficult to achieve seamless integration. Due to problems including lengthy build times, complex asset management, and dependence on graphical resources. Notwithstanding these possible obstacles, our goal is to set up a continuous integration pipeline that provides reliable feedback on code quality by automatically running tests whenever work is posted to the repository. It is important to note that this may not be entirely feasible.
  \end{itemize}


\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\noindent Our software validation will involve confirming that the system meets user expectations and the requirements outlined in the SRS.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stakeholder Review Sessions}: In order to make sure that requirements match user expectations and needs, we will arrange semi-regular review meetings with our supervisor and potential users, who are stakeholders. These meetings will be used to modify requirements as needed and will provide validation for newly developed components of the system.
  \item \textbf{Task-Based Inspection}: In order to demonstrate that the system performs as intended, the team will develop use-case scenarios and conduct task-based inspections to validate whether or not the system operates correctly.
  \item \textbf{Rev 0 Demo Feedback}: For the purpose of further refining the system and optimizing it prior to the final release, the team will collect feedback from our supervisor both before and after the Rev 0 demo. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent These strategies are additions to the ones outlined in section 2.2.


\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}
