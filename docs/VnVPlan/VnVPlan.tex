\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique

plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

This project creates an online multiplayer game platform that allows for the creation of
custom Yahtzee-like games and variants. This family of games will come with some presets
such as classic Yahtzee, an octahedron version, and more, but will allow for the
users to set their own variables such as number of dice, what kind of dice, and some elements
of scoring, and then play that game. Kinds of dice would include cubes and octahedrons,
among other multi-sided dice, and scoring could be calculated at the end of the game, as in
classic Yahtzee, or on a per-round basis, where hands go in a head-to-head matchup.

\subsection{Objectives}

\iffalse
\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}
\fi

The main objective of this project is to ensure robust and flexible functionality that supports customizability in game creation, with confidence in their interactability. Specifically, the project will focus on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Demonstrating Adequate Usability: User interactions should be intuitive, enabling smooth navigation and game setup without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
	\item Supporting User-Driven Customizability: Emphasis will be placed on making the platform adaptable, allowing users to easily create and modify games with various dice types and scoring rules. These elements must be modular such that a custom game can make use of these components in a flexible fashion.
	\item Ensuring Software Correctness: Testing will confirm accurate dice roll usage, score calculations, and game outcomes to build confidence in the correctness of the core mechanics.
\end{itemize}

Out of Scope Objectives: Due to time constraints, certain areas are out of scope for this project. These include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Probability Testing: While a statistical analysis could be done on the randomness of dice rolls, it would be out of scope for our current plans and we will proceed with a general assumption that functions that rely on random values are as accurately pseudo-random as needed, without set seeding.
	\item Performance Optimization: While performance will be monitored, extensive optimization for faulty connections or intricate rule configurations will be left out, with plans to address this in potential future releases.
\end{itemize}

This prioritization allows us to allocate resources efficiently, focusing on core functionality and foundational elements.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\iffalse
\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}
\fi

Through the implementation of not just a single Yahtzee game variant, but by implementing a system where the user can create a custom game variant and connect to another online player to play it, we are looking to develop our project to be both a fun game and a capstone project. The challenge difficulty approved is that of general.

%TODO update problem statement and gitlab once we know difficulty level and what extras
\iffalse
, we are looking to achieve the advanced challenge level. We would also provide some pre-set game variants that have been tested and were found to be more fun than others.
\fi

We will include extra elements to aid in better developing our game and allow us to design for a fun gaming experience. Following industry practices in game development, we will do the following extras:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus groups, Surveys, and Interviews, focused on Usability Testing
	\item User documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\iffalse
\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}
\citet{SRS}
\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}
\fi

The following documents are crucial for the Verification and Validation process, ensuring the project meets its objectives and operates reliably:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/John-Popovici/duel-of-the-eights/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)}: This document outlines the core requirements for the platform, defining features and limitations, as well as expected behaviors. The SRS serves as a primary reference to validate that the developed software meets user and system requirements.
	\item \href{https://github.com/John-Popovici/duel-of-the-eights/blob/main/docs/HazardAnalysis/HazardAnalysis.pdf}{Hazard Analysis (HA)}: This document is key to identifying and managing risks associated with system failures, particularly in dice physics, scoring, and multiplayer stability.
	\item \href{https://github.com/John-Popovici/duel-of-the-eights/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{Module Interface Specification (MIS)}: The MIS details the interfaces between components, which is essential for ensuring seamless interaction across modules and verifying that dependencies are managed correctly.
	\item \href{https://github.com/John-Popovici/duel-of-the-eights/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{Module Guide (MG)}: The MG provides a structural breakdown of the system's components, allowing verification that each module aligns with the SRS specifications and functions as intended.
\end{itemize}


\section{Plan}

%\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to come.}

\noindent This section covers the project's verification and validation (V\&V) strategy, including the methodologies and strategies used to ensure software dependability, correctness, and usability. Each component of the plan will establish verification and validation procedures appropriate for each stage of the project lifecycle, from reviewing the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to testing the developed system.

\end{table}

\newpage
\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\noindent The SRS verification will take an organized approach, including supervisor and peer review sessions, to ensure that the stated requirements are clear, accurate, and thorough. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structured Review Meeting}: Conducted with the supervisor in person to present the essential SRS components. The team will highlight the essential functional and non-functional requirements and solicit feedback on the clarity and feasibility of each requirement. The feedback will then be tracked as issues and be used to make any modifications deemed necessary.
    \item \textbf{Checklist Creation}: A detailed checklist will be prepared to analyze each SRS item, ensuring the requirements are accurate and feasible for execution. The checklist will be utilized at each review session. If the checklist is filled out completely, the team will know that there are no necessary changes and if it is not then necessary modifications will be made to the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Peer Review Sessions}: The team will have our peers, such as classmates, complete task-based inspections of the SRS to identify any ambiguities or missing components. Tasks may include examining the document for completeness, by ensuring that all functional and non-functional requirements are properly stated, checking for terminology consistency, and ensuring that any assumptions or restrictions are well-defined and reasonably made. This will ensure that the SRS is complete and viable. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\noindent To ensure that the design complies with the SRS standards, the team will conduct a structured review process including the entire team, external peers and the teams supervisor:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design Checklists}:  A checklist will be developed to guide reviewers through each design component and confirm whether or not they correspond to both the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Peer Review}: Classmates and primary reviewers will use the checklist to determine if the design is consistent with the SRS. This includes the code structure, front-end design, and game mechanics. 
    \item \textbf{Structured Review Meeting}: The team will schedule a review session with our supervisor where each design element will be presented. The goal being to receive feedback and make any necessary modifications. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\noindent The V\&V plan itself will be verified to make sure it adequately addresses every facet of the project and sufficiently plans appropriate methods of verification and validation.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mutation Testing}: To guarantee robustness of our software, we'll use mutation testing to assess how well the test cases work and to make sure that the methods used for verification can accurately detect software faults.
  \item \textbf{Review Sessions}: To ensure that all necessary verification and validation methods are covered, the V\&V plan will be reviewed by the teams peers and supervisor utilizing a checklist. The team will also independently review the methods to ensure all bases are covered.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\noindent The implementation verification will primarily focus on unit testing and manual testing, emphasizing the isolation of modules and testing them with constant inputs mimicking user inputs. Given that project is a game, testing poses unique challenges and nuances that require careful consideration.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unit Testing}: The team will employ isolated unit tests, setting fixed inputs to verify core functionalities like game logic, scoring systems, and user input handling.  Simulations of dice rolls and the scores that go along with them are one example. Additionally, to ensure that tests only concentrate on the module's functionality and are not influenced by outside factors, mocking will be used to mimic external dependencies.
  \item \textbf{Manual Testing}: Manual testing will be used to evaluate the game from a player's point of view and make sure that gameplay is fluid, intuitive, and stimulating, manual testing will be used. In order to find any possible errors or discrepancies in the game mechanics, test cases will cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases and user interactions.
  \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs}: In order to collect feedback on code correctness, standard compliance adherence, and alignment with design specifications outlined in the SRS, team-based code walkthroughs will be carried out. These walkthroughs will be held with our peers and external individuals with expertise in the field.
  \item \textbf{Static Analysis}: FxCop, a free static code analysis tool from Microsoft, will be utilized to evaluate the code. It excels at analyzing .NET managed code assemblies for adherence to Microsoft's .NET Framework Design Guidelines. This tool will help ensure code quality and identify potential issues early in the development cycle. It is particularly well-suited for this project, as the game is being developed using C\# on the .NET version of Godot.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\noindent To maintain code quality and reliability, teh team will implement a variety of automated testing tools. Any mentioned tools are not finalized and may be substituted based on team preferences and needs:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing Framework}: The team will employ a unit testing framework, such as NUnit or xUnit, recommended by Microsoft, to automate our test cases. This will help ensure that each game feature functions consistently and accurately.
    \item \textbf{Test Coverage Tools}: The team will utilize Coverlet which provides a cross-platform code coverage framework for C\#. As part of the .NET Foundation, Coverlet is recommended by Microsoft and will help us track coverage metrics to ensure our tests sufficiently cover the core components of the system.
    \item \textbf{Linters}: The team will integrate language-specific linters, like Roslyn analyzers recommended by Microsoft, to ensure our code adheres to best practices and established coding standards.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI)}: The team will try to use a continuous integration platform, such GitHub Actions. However, the unique demands of game development could make it difficult to achieve seamless integration. Due to problems including lengthy build times, complex asset management, and dependence on graphical resources. Notwithstanding these possible obstacles, our goal is to set up a continuous integration pipeline that provides reliable feedback on code quality by automatically running tests whenever work is posted to the repository. It is important to note that this may not be entirely feasible.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\noindent Our software validation will involve confirming that the system meets user expectations and the requirements outlined in the SRS.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stakeholder Review Sessions}: In order to make sure that requirements match user expectations and needs, we will arrange semi-regular review meetings with our supervisor and potential users, who are stakeholders. These meetings will be used to modify requirements as needed and will provide validation for newly developed components of the system.
  \item \textbf{Task-Based Inspection}: In order to demonstrate that the system performs as intended, the team will develop use-case scenarios and conduct task-based inspections to validate whether or not the system operates correctly. For example, one use-case scenario could be a player seeking to accomplish a "Full House" by rolling three dice of one number and two of another. A task-based inspection would include ensuring that the system correctly recognizes and scores this combination as a Full House, awarding the required points.
  \item \textbf{Rev 0 Demo Feedback}: For the purpose of further refining the system and optimizing it prior to the final release, the team will collect feedback from our supervisor both before and after the Rev 0 demo. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent These strategies are additions to the ones outlined in section 2.2.

approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\subsubsection{Module ?}
		
\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input/Condition: 
					
Output/Result: 
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output:

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\wss{This is a section that would be appropriate for some projects.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We were able to use past year examples to set up our document and understand what contents to add to each section - Hemraj B
    \item Since we had already done the requirements and hazard analysis documentation, we had a better understanding of the project we are designing for. Additionally, we have a better idea of what the project will come to look like given we are developing our proof of concept. - John P.
  \end{itemize}
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sections 3 and 4, were confusing in terms of us thinking that both essentially meant the same thing. We resolved this by looking at the previous year's examples and were able to figure out the differences between the two sections - Hemraj B
      \item We wanted to focus more attention to the proof of concept, but this deadline could come useful for near the end of the project. - John P.
      \item When it comes to choosing a challenge level, this is something that needs to be set with a meeting with the professor. We had initially had the project as advanced on the proposal, but the professor said everyone is expected to start with a general level. A meeting with the professor is something that would have helped this section. - John P.
    \end{itemize}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We will need to familiarize ourselves with testing methods that were mentioned in our document such as Coverlet and FxCop  - Hemraj B
    \item We are working with GoDot, so we need to do some exploration with what tools best work with that software. Additionally, since this is a game we are developing where most elements are driven by user interaction. This also brings some difficulties and thus something that we need to explore. - John P.
    \item As of right now there is no CI/CD element to our repository, especially given that 100\% of the commits to the main branch as of right now are for documentation. This is a skill we need to develop and brainstorm how we can best make use of this technology. - John P.
  \end{itemize}
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We will acquire knowledge of Coverlet and FxCop through watching educational videos on YouTube and we will create trial projects to practice the software and familiarise ourselves with the tools available on each software - Hemraj B
    \item We need to do research on GoDot and how verification tools can work with it. This would come through looking at online resources that have some experience with GoDot and we can use their expertise, but could also come through locally testing different software methods and bringing them to the team once integrated. Similarly with testing mostly user driven interactions, we would need to brainstorm as a team and test options, but perhaps also bring it up to the professor and TAs who might have useful ideas. - John P.
    \item The problem of having CI/CD testing for games has been brought up in lecture, and as such is an issue the professor and TAs should be aware of. Asking for their advice and experience would be useul in this regard, as would searching online forums and videos for what others have done. This can take place at the same time as the above bullet point, since GoDot is primarily used for game development. - John P.
