\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Since we already had the VnV Plan in a completed state, we were familiar with both the product and the VnV process we were looking to undertake. (John P.)
\end{itemize}  
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    
\begin{itemize}
  \item This deliverable came near the end of the development process, when the game was mostly completed save some final features and bugs, meaning there was some lack in motivation due to the work being more maintenance based. There was additionally exams and other events during this time. To help resolve this, the extension to the due date was of help and meetings where we discussed the final steps and end goals were had to help us hunker down and get the work over with. (John P.)
\end{itemize}    
    
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?

\begin{itemize}
  \item The most significant element of this document that stemmed from speaking to the stakeholders of the project came through usability testing and playtesting feedback. As of 2025-03-09, 27 of 137 feature and bug issues on github stem from playtesting feedback. This feedback comes from external testing as we had internal testing and playtesting as well which generated issues. These issues addressed different elements of functional and nonfuctional requirements but especially led to the use of the section addressing changes due to testing. (John P.)
\end{itemize}
  
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
