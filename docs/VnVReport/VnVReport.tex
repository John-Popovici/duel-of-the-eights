\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}


\subsection{R1: PVP support}
\label{R1}

 \subsubsection*{Description:}  The game shall support an online player vs player mode, where 2 players can play against
each other.

 \subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}  2 players can connect to each other over an internet connection.
 
 \subsubsection*{Pass or fail? :}
 
 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
 We have tested multiple versions of our game, and in each of those versions, we have verified though testing that two players on separate Windows devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network can successfully establish a connection to each other, verify their connectivity, and take turns without issues. Based on these successful tests, we confirm that this requirement has been met.
 
 \subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: }  
 
  \noindent \textbf{ Test-1}. The manual test, Test-1 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we executed the test, the system passed the test, confirming that the requirement had been met.


\subsection{R2: Yatzee score calculations}
\label{R2} 
  
   \subsubsection*{Description:}  The game shall handle score calculations using similar rules to standard Yahtzee under default game settings.

 \subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}  Scores in default Yahtzee must match those obtained from an official Yahtzee score calculator (depending on house rules).
 
 \subsubsection*{Pass or fail? :}
 
 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
 Through the comparisons between our hand calculated yahtzee  expected score and the games calculated score for each type of rolled hand, we have confirmed that the game can calculated the correct score for each type of hand based on yahtzee rules, and then display these calculations on the scoreboard. In addition, these calculations can adapt to the custom settings made by the players. As the game's calculated scores matches our expected scores, we can safely say that this requirement has been met. 
 
 \subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: }  \textbf{ Test-2}. The automated test, Test-2 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we used these tests, they were all passed, confirming that the requirement had been met.


\subsection{R3: Dice Roll Physics} 
\label{R3}  
  
\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall simulate realistic physics for 3D dice rolls with pseudo-randomness on every roll that replicates accurately to all users. If rolling $AdX$ dice, $A$ numbers will have to be determined from the range $1 \geq A_{i} \geq X$.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} The result of a roll must be pseudo-random, adhere to physics-based simulation, and be accurately displayed to all players.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
 In our current version, we have working 3D dice models that are physically rolled in front of the player, with methods to address and resolve any invalid rolls or collisions issues related to the rolling of the physical dice.  This requirement has been met by out project.

 \subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: }  \textbf{ Test-3}. The manual test, Test-3 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we executed the test, the system passed the test, confirming that the requirement had been met.


\subsection{R4: Dice roll results} 
\label{R4} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall use the real outcome of a roll to get the values from the dice.
  
\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} Dice values displayed on the UI must match the final resting state of the 3D dice model after rolling.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 
 
  \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
 In our current version, We can visually confirm that the results for each dice roll in the UI match the results of the physically rolled 3D dice models after they have finished rolling. This requirement has been met.
 
  \subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{ Test-3}. Though designed for Requirement 3 specifically, we have confirmed that requirement 4 has been met as well while implementing Test-3, as by physically rolling the dice, we were able to visually see that our rolled results match the results displayed in our UI.
  
  
\subsection{R5: Multi Dice support} 
\label{R5} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall support both regular six-sided dice and a set of dice with different number of sides, such as octahedral dice.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} Players can select dice with different numbers of sides, and the game correctly processes rolls for all supported dice types.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
In our current version of our game, players can select from 4, 6, 8, and 10 sided dice. We have dice models for all four options, and they can all be rolled in game without issue. In addition, score calculators can adapt to the player's selected dice model. This requirement has been met.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{N/A}. Though there is no explict test from the VnV plan dedicated to this Requirement, we have tested this requirement manually through \textbf{Test-3} by loading the game, selecting our desired dice type, and then starting the game to see if the game can run using our selected dice option without issue. Since our current version can run any of the selected dice types without issue, the above test passes, confirming that the above requirement has been met.


\subsection{R6: Simultaneous turn mechanism} 
\label{R6} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall implement a simultaneous turn based mechanism such that each player (or computer) takes a turn at the same time and then results are revealed simultaneously to each other at each dice roll.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} Each player takes actions simultaneously, and results are revealed to both players once each has selected an action.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
  In our current version, players automatically take their turns at the same time. The game is set so that both players automatically roll dice, select dice, and select their score for that round at the same time. This requirement has therefore been met.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{test-4}.  The manual test, Test-4 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we executed the test, the system passed the test, confirming that the requirement had been met.


\subsection{R7: Dice Selection} 
\label{R7} 

\subsubsection*{Description:} The game shall allow players to pick which dice they would like to use for each roll, and which dice they would like to omit. Selected dice will be a subset of the current dice in play belonging to that player $D' \subseteq D$.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} Players can select a subset of their dice before rolling, and the game correctly rolls only the selected dice.


\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
 In our current version, Players can choose which dice they want to re-roll, which will highlight when selected. When the dice are rolled again, only selected dice will be rerolled. In addition, we have a special toggle option that allows for the inverse, which when activated causes \underline{unselected} dice to be rerolled instead of the selected ones. This requirement has been met.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{Test-6}.  The automated test, Test-6 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we ran those tests, the tests all passed, confirming that the requirement has been met.\\
\textbf{Test-3}. The manual test of dice rolling also works towards confirming this requirement.


\subsection{R8: User Interface} 
\label{R8} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}  The game shall display some sort of user interface to display scores, number of rolls, time limits, state of dice, and player names.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} The UI must display the score, roll count, time limits, dice states, and player names without omissions or inconsistencies.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
 Our current version has a UI display that provides the player will all relevant information, including score, roll count, time limits, and the names and dice states of both the player and his or her opponent. This requirement has been met.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{test-5}.  The Manual test, Test-5 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we executed the test, the system passed the test, confirming that the requirement had been met.

 
\subsection{R9: Custom games} 
\label{R9}

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall provide controls for the player to modify the game settings to access unique variants of the game.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}Players must be able to access and modify at least 3 game settings before a game is started.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
  Our current version Provides players with a wide variaty of options to modify. Depending on the players selected game mode, players can alter the number of rounds, the type of dice, the allowed hands for the game, rolls per round, the number of dice that can be rolled, and even the game's win condition. This requirement has been well met.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{test-8}.  The Manual test, Test-8 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we executed the test, the system passed the test, confirming that the requirement had been met.


\subsection{R10: Preset Selection} 
\label{R10} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall provide presets for different game modes.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}Players must be able to select from at least one preset game mode in the settings menu.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{PASS}\\
 
  Our current version offers players three pre-set game modes: Standard, which closely follows traditional Yahtzee rules; Bluff, which incorporates health points and a bluffing system; and Blitz, which features a shorter timer to encourage faster rounds. Each mode applies unique parameters and settings tailored to its gameplay style, and when the game modes are selected, the unique parameters are present in the game. This requirement has therefore been met.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{test-7}.  The Manual test, Test-7 from the VnV Plan, is relevant to this requirement and when we executed the test, the system passed the test, confirming that the requirement had been met.


\subsection{R11: Local multiplayer} 
\label{R11} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall support a local player vs player mode, where 2 players can play against each other on the same computer.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}Two players can take turns using the same computer without errors or UI conflicts.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{Fail}\\
 
  This Requirement is outside of our scope at the current stage of our project, as it is a stretch requirement, and as such hasn't been met yet.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{N/A}. This requirement was out of scope for this project, and as such no test for requirement R11 was created in the VnV plan.


\subsection{R12: Singleplayer} 
\label{R12} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall support a player vs computer mode, where 1 player can play against another entity without needing to find a human match.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} A player can start a game against a computer opponent without needing a human opponent.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{Fail}\\
 
 This requirement has not been met, because no single player algorithm exists yet. In addition, this Requirement is also outside of our scope at the current stage of our project, as it is a stretch requirement, and as such hasn't been met yet.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{N/A}. This requirement was out of scope for this project, and because of that no test for requirement R12 was created in the VnV plan.


\subsection{R13: Singleplayer Algorithm} 
\label{R13} 

\subsubsection*{Description:} The game shall implement some sort of algorithmic computer opponent for  player vs computer gameplay option.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:} The computer opponent makes legal and strategic moves, ensuring a playable experience.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{Fail}\\
 
  No AI algorithm has been implemented yet, and as such this Requirement hasn't been met yet. This Requirement is also outside of our scope at the current stage of our project, as it is a stretch requirement, and as such it hasn't been met yet.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{N/A}. This requirement was out of scope for this project, and because of that no test for requirement R13 was created in the VnV Plan.


\subsection{R14: Online Matchmaking} 
\label{R14} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall implement online matchmaking.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}Players can search for and be matched with online opponents.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{Fail}\\
 
 \noindent As of the current state of the project, this requirement remains outside the scope of the project since it's a stretch goal, and as such hasn't been implemented yet. 

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{Test-1}. Testing the PvP functionally is done through both LAN network testing and online server connections.


\subsection{R15: Saving game settings} 
\label{R15} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall provide the option to save specific game settings to be reused in future sessions.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}Players can save and load custom game settings across different play sessions.


\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{Pass}\\
 
 \noindent As of this current version, users can now save their custom game settings and then load those same game settings even after they closed their old game session and started a new one. This requirement has been met.

\subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{Test-8}. We have tested this requirement by setting up a game, saving our game settings, and then confirming that our custom game setting was still saved after ending my current session and beginning another. As our game settings remain saved and implementable even after new game sessions are begun, we can safely say that the game passes the test, and by extension, meets the requirement.


\subsection{R16: end of game statistics} 
\label{R16} 

\subsubsection*{Description:}The game shall display game statistics to each player at the end of every round.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}At the end of a game, the game displays statistics such as total score, average roll, and average score per round.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{Pass}\\
 
 \noindent As of this current version of the game, A game display showing the total score and remaining health for both players is shown at the end of every game. As such, while we consider this requirement to have been met, we are also planning on adding more statistics such as average roll, and average score per round later on in the project.
 
 \subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{N/A}. No relevant test from the VnV Plan was created for this Requirement, however, we have tested this requirement manually by playing the game to the end and seeing if the end of game results show up. As the end of game statistics show up after the end of every game we've played, we can safely say that the game passes our above test, and by extension that this requirement has been met as well.


\subsection{R17: Consistent and Correct game state} 
\label{R17} 

\subsubsection*{Description:} The game shall always show the correct current state accurately.

\subsubsection*{Fit Criterion:}The game state (e.g., current scores, dice states, turn order) is always correctly updated and visible to the player.

\subsubsection*{Pass or Fail? :} 

 \noindent \textbf{Pass}\\
 
 \noindent In our current iteration of the project, so far, we have been able to get our game stable enough to the point that we can consistently play though various rounds without issues, and the current state of the game is always correct and viable to the player throughout the entire match. This requirement has been met.
 
 \subsubsection*{Relevant VnV Plan test: } \textbf{N/A}. No relevant test specific to this requirement was created in the VnV Plan. However, we have tested this requirement manually by  playing though a game and checking the UI to see if the correct game state is displayed throughout the whole game. As we had found no issues when conducting this test multiple times, we can safely say that the game has passed this test, and by extension, that this requirement has been met.

\textbf{Evaluation Criteria:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item UI elements and 3D assets should follow a predefined style guide.
    \item No major inconsistencies in visual elements should be present across different screens and game states.
    \item Players should not report jarring or conflicting visual themes.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Results from Verification and Validation Plan:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item No applicable tests were included in the Verification and Validation Plan for appearance validation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{User Feedback from Usability Testing Report:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item No players reported \textbf{issues with UI theming or inconsistencies}.
    \item Testers found the game’s UI and 3D visual style \textbf{cohesive and visually appealing}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Internal Testing and Implementation Measures:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{consistent UI theme file} was used throughout the game to ensure uniformity.
    \item A predefined \textbf{color palette and style guide} was applied to all UI elements.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Final Assessment:} \textbf{Pass}  

The game meets the \textbf{appearance requirement}, as usability testing confirmed no reported inconsistencies in UI theming or 3D assets. Internal testing ensured adherence to a predefined style guide, validating this requirement.


\subsubsection{NFR-10: Portability (MacOS Support)}
\label{NFR10}

\textbf{Requirement Description:}  
The game shall be supported on MacOS devices to expand its potential audience and ensure accessibility for Mac users.

\textbf{Evaluation Criteria:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item The game must successfully install and run on MacOS devices.
    \item The game must not have major performance issues or compatibility errors.
    \item Testing must be conducted on at least two different MacOS versions to validate cross-version compatibility.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Results from Verification and Validation Plan:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item No applicable tests were conducted in the Verification and Validation Plan, as MacOS support was out of scope for this phase of development, but when included \textbf{Test-11} would be used for confirmation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{User Feedback from Usability Testing Report:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item No usability testing was conducted on MacOS devices.
    \item All usability tests were performed on Windows PCs, meaning MacOS compatibility was not assessed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Final Assessment:} \textbf{Fail (Stretch Goal)}  

MacOS support was identified as a \textbf{stretch goal} and was not included in the current development phase. As a result, no testing was conducted to verify MacOS compatibility, and the requirement remains unfulfilled at this stage. Future development efforts will need to include testing on MacOS devices before this requirement can be considered met.


\subsection{Conclusion}

The evaluation of the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for \textbf{Dice Duels} demonstrates that the game successfully meets most of its defined criteria. The validation process involved a combination of tests outlined in the \textbf{Verification and Validation (V\&V) Plan} and \textbf{Usability Testing Reports}, ensuring that the game meets expected performance, usability, reliability, and appearance standards.

Out of the ten evaluated NFRs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Seven NFRs} (\textit{Performance, Usability, Portability (Windows), Reliability, Responsiveness, Modularity, and Appearance}) received a \textbf{Pass}, indicating full compliance with their respective fit criteria.
    \item \textbf{Two NFRs} (\textit{Efficiency and Enjoyability}) received a \textbf{Conditional Pass}, as they met requirements but have areas identified for further refinement in future updates.
    \item \textbf{One NFR} (\textit{Portability (MacOS Support)}) received a \textbf{Fail}, as MacOS support was identified as a stretch goal and was not tested in this phase of development.
\end{itemize}

The results highlight that \textbf{Dice Duels} is a stable, performant, and engaging game that effectively delivers a seamless player experience. The game's \textbf{modular architecture and efficient UI design} ensure that it can be extended and improved upon in future iterations. The two conditionally passing requirements (\textit{Efficiency and Enjoyability}) indicate that while the game is functional and enjoyable, there is room for optimization in music variety and further UI refinements.

The only failing NFR, MacOS support, was acknowledged as \textbf{out of scope for this phase} and will require targeted testing and development in a future iteration to meet the stated fit criterion.

\textbf{Future Work:}  
To further enhance the game’s quality, future testing should focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Further optimizing \textbf{efficiency} to ensure the game runs smoothly on low-end hardware.
    \item Expanding \textbf{usability enhancements}, such as improving UI clarity for scoring and variant tutorials.
    \item Conducting \textbf{MacOS compatibility testing} to fulfill the portability requirement.
    \item Refining \textbf{multiplayer connection stability} to improve overall reliability.
\end{itemize}

Overall, \textbf{Dice Duels} meets its core non-functional requirements and provides a strong foundation for future development, ensuring a high-quality and engaging experience for players.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

The team used multiple code coverage techniques to ensure the code was thoroughly tested. This section describes the techniques used, such as function coverage and branch coverage, but does not include specific metrics like the percentage of code covered due to limitations of the development environment. The Godot engine does not have a feature to track code coverage of tests.

Function coverage was employed to verify and validate that each function in the codebase was executed at least once and performed as expected. Through this method, the team was able to test all the parts of code responsible for processing game data such as any function relating to scoring and user settings. The technique helped identify any potential problems with any of the functions that aided in-game states being altered or sent from one player to another. Through these tests, the team was able to validate the correctness of the system in regard to any internal calculations that had to be conducted by the system.  

Branch coverage was also employed which went even deeper by testing all possible paths within any decision-making functions. This method aided in verifying and validating the game's decision-making processes. Through this method, the team was able to understand any flaws associated with the game's handling of user decisions such as choosing to roll or not roll dice as each option led to a different outcome.  Thus by covering almost every possible deviation, the team minimized any logical errors that could occur during gameplay due to user actions.

Overall, while specific coverage metrics were unavailable to aid the team in understanding how much of the code was being tested, the team created comprehensive test cases covering all major functions, decision points, and smaller utility functions. This approach helped the team ensure that the majority of the code base was tested and performed as expected.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Since we already had the VnV Plan in a completed state, we were familiar with both the product and the VnV process we were looking to undertake. (John P.)
\end{itemize}  
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    
\begin{itemize}
  \item This deliverable came near the end of the development process, when the game was mostly completed save some final features and bugs, meaning there was some lack in motivation due to the work being more maintenance based. There was additionally exams and other events during this time. To help resolve this, the extension to the due date was of help and meetings where we discussed the final steps and end goals were had to help us hunker down and get the work over with. (John P.)
\end{itemize}    
    
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?

\begin{itemize}
  \item The most significant element of this document that stemmed from speaking to the stakeholders of the project came through usability testing and playtesting feedback. As of 2025-03-09, 27 of 137 feature and bug issues on github stem from playtesting feedback. This feedback comes from external testing as we had internal testing and playtesting as well which generated issues. These issues addressed different elements of functional and nonfuctional requirements but especially led to the use of the section addressing changes due to testing. (John P.)
\end{itemize}
  
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
