\section{Introduction}

Game system design is often perceived as straightforward because users interact primarily with the front end, unaware of the complexities that lie behind the scenes in the back end. In reality, it consists of multiple different components working together in order to create a seamless experience for the user.\\

As digital gaming continues to evolve, understanding these various components and their interplay is essential. Thus it is crucial to examine the potential challenges and requirements that may emerge within these components to improve the overall system.

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here. Hemraj note: added vague intro and moved defination to its own section}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

The purpose of this document is to assess the potential hazards associated with the system under development. The ultimate goal is to implement strategies that either eliminate these hazards or reduce them to an acceptable level. To achieve this, the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method was employed, which aided in systematically identifying and prioritizing hazards. A thorough analysis was conducted on various aspects of the system, including requirements, design, and code implementation.\\

The scope of this document is to identify possible hazards within the software components of the game system, including the game mechanics, user interface, and multiplayer functionalities. It aims to analyze the effects and causes of potential failures such as performance degradation and outright system failure. Through this, mitigation strategies, safety and security requirements for users were established. Importantly, the scope does not include any hardware components as the system is purely software based and any hardware hazards are not within the control of the developers.

\section{Hazard Definition}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Latex} & \textbf{Definition} \\ \hline
    \textbf{System Hazard} & A condition that could foreseeably cause or contribute to the system going down or loss of performance. \\ \hline
    \textbf{Risk} & A measure that indicates the likelihood of a system hazard. \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Definitions of System Hazard and Risk}
\end{table}

A hazard, in the context of this system, is defined as any property, software, or component that leads to reduced performance or complete system failure.


\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Godot Stability}: The Godot game engine is assumed to be stable and function correctly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}
\subsection{Hazards Considered Out of Scope}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hardware-Specific Failures}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Issues related to hardware malfunctions such as GPU or CPU overheating, RAM failures, or hard drive corruption.
            \item \textit{Rationale}: The FMEA table is focused on software development within the Godot game engine, and hardware reliability is typically managed by the userâ€™s computer environment.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Operating System Crashes or Instability}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Operating system crashes, updates, or security vulnerabilities that interrupt game sessions.
            \item \textit{Rationale}: These are dependent on the player's system and not directly related to the game's software development or behavior.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Network Infrastructure Failures}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Failures due to external network outages, router malfunctions, or ISP-level disruptions.
            \item \textit{Rationale}: These are beyond the game's control and depend on the player's internet setup or service provider.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Third-Party Library Bugs or Vulnerabilities}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bugs or security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or plugins used within the Godot engine.
            \item \textit{Rationale}: While the game relies on third-party tools, the FMEA focuses on bugs and issues within the game code itself, not third-party dependencies.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Player Misuse or Exploits}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Players intentionally trying to exploit the game, cheat, or use unauthorized modifications.
            \item \textit{Rationale}: Handling intentional misuse or hacking is outside the game's core development, and managing these issues requires external anti-cheat measures or monitoring.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Privacy and Security Breaches}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unauthorized data access, or privacy breaches.
            \item \textit{Rationale}: The FMEA focuses on in-game functionalities like dice rolls, AI, and scoring. Data privacy concerns involve external security practices and infrastructure, which are beyond the game's core software behavior.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Non-Game Software Interference}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interference from other software running on the user's machine, like antivirus programs or system background tasks.
            \item \textit{Rationale}: These external software influences are outside the game's scope of control and would be handled by system administrators or users.
        \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Team members communicated often and effectively. - Isaac G.
        \item Code changes were handled well without merge conflicts. - Isaac G.
	\end{itemize}

    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item With many midterms for everyone finding time to meet and work was a challenge. We were still able to compare shedules and find meeting times that we could all make, and everyone communicated well to let team members know when they would have time to get to their part(s) of the deliverable done. - Isaac G.
	\end{itemize}

    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
