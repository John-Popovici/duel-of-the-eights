\section{Introduction}

Game system design is often perceived as straightforward because users interact primarily with the front end, unaware of the complexities that lie behind the scenes in the back end. In reality, it consists of multiple different components working together in order to create a seamless experience for the user.\\

As digital gaming continues to evolve, understanding these various components and their interplay is essential. Thus it is crucial to examine the potential challenges and requirements that may emerge within these components to improve the overall system.

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here. Hemraj note: added vague intro and moved defination to its own section}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

The purpose of this document is to assess the potential hazards associated with the system under development. The ultimate goal is to implement strategies that either eliminate these hazards or reduce them to an acceptable level. To achieve this, the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method was employed, which aided in systematically identifying and prioritizing hazards. A thorough analysis was conducted on various aspects of the system, including requirements, design, and code implementation.\\

The scope of this document is to identify possible hazards within the software components of the game system, including the game mechanics, user interface, and multiplayer functionalities. It aims to analyze the effects and causes of potential failures such as performance degradation and outright system failure. Through this, mitigation strategies, safety and security requirements for users were established. Importantly, the scope does not include any hardware components as the system is purely software based and any hardware hazards are not within the control of the developers.

\section{Hazard Definition}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Latex} & \textbf{Definition} \\ \hline
    \textbf{System Hazard} & A condition that could foreseeably cause or contribute to the system going down or loss of performance. \\ \hline
    \textbf{Risk} & A measure that indicates the likelihood of a system hazard. \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Definitions of System Hazard and Risk}
\end{table}

A hazard, in the context of this system, is defined as any property, software, or component that leads to reduced performance or complete system failure.


\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
