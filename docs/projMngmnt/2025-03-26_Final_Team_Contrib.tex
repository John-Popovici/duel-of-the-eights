between Rev 0 and the Final documentation.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of team meetings held by the team.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\section{Commits}
