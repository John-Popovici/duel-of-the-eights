\section{Problem Statement}

%\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
%\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}{problem statement checklist}.} 
%\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}

Games are a staple of entertainment and are used to bring people together for both competition and fun.
There can often be a desire to share the experience of playing a game with someone but meeting can be hard or impossible in-person and so having an online version of popular games allows for such opportunities.

One such game is the game of Yahtzee, which while it does have online versions, are limited to the classic rule-set and do not allow for variants to be designed and played.
Yahtzee is a game many know yet is not often played, yet by leveraging the most interesting game mechanics and creating different variants, we could reinvigorate the genre while paying homage to the original.

As developers, we are aiming to create an environment in which Yahtzee and Yahtzee variants can be designed and played with some preset rule-sets to be used as a starting-off point. This would allow for both the classic game as well as different variants of it, such as using 8-sided dice, to be played with a friend online.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

%\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
%Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}
Upon running the program, a game user would be capable of selecting to play either preset game configurations, or to customize their own given a set of game rules they can select and modify. In starting the game, these game rules would be instantiated and the user could play the Yahtzee version selected with another online player.

In terms of interacting with the game, two players will exist and have the ability to interact with the current game state, allowing them to make decisions based on game events. The game state will be presented through a visual user interface displaying different elements of the game, including the dice and points system(s).

\subsection{Stakeholders}

Our stakeholders are primarily those people that would spend their time playing the game, falling into the following categories.

Traditional Yahtzee enthusiasts are familiar with the classic Yahtzee ruleset and are generally older and may prefer the simplicity and nostalgia of the original game. They may not be too tech-savvy, but still wish to revisit the game and connect with friends, possibly exploring customization in moderation, without overwhelming complexity.

Typical gamers can span from casual to more dedicated gamers, have experience with online multiplayer, and are looking for an engaging experience with a friend. Having a faster paced experience with more skill expression and instant feedback is something they would be interested in.


\subsection{Environment}

%\wss{Hardware and software environment}

The game will be run on Windows 10 devices and be run with an internet connection to enable online multiplayer. One of the players would act as the host with the other connecting such that they can play in real-time with an online connection.

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\iffalse
\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}
\fi

Through the implementation of not just a single Yahtzee game variant, but by implementing a system where the user can create a custom game variant and connect to another online player to play it, we are looking to achieve the advanced challenge level. We would also provide some pre-set game variants that have been tested and were found to be more fun than others.

We will include extra elements to aid in better developing our game and allow us to design for a fun gaming experience, as we wish this game to not be just a capstone project, but a game we can be proud of and put out into the world. Following industry practices in game development, we wish to potentially do the following extras:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus groups, Surveys, and Interviews
	\item Usability testing
	\item User personas
	\item User documentation
\end{itemize}

    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
