\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}

This section, titled "Auxiliary Constants," has been intentionally omitted as it is more appropriate for documents that require the definition and organization of numerous constants and parameters. In the context of our project, which focuses on the game variants, the need for such a section is minimal.

The constants and parameters relevant to the game family are already comprehensively addressed in other parts of this document, particularly within the sections dealing with Commonalities, Variabilities, and Parameters of Variations. These sections provide all necessary explanations and definitions in a self-contained manner. Given that these parameters are specific to certain features of the game and are clearly outlined where applicable, adding an additional section on auxiliary constants would be redundant and not add any meaningful value to the document. Therefore, we have chosen to skip this section for the sake of clarity and to avoid unnecessary duplication.

%\plt{Show the values of the symbolic parameters introduced in the report.}

%\plt{The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
%Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.}

%\plt{The value of FRACTION, for the Maintainability NFR would be given here.}
