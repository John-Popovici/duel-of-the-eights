\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Template introduction refactored. A few wording changes.}\\

\noindent{}Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing software. A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. For the Dual of the Eights project, we advocate a decomposition based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}. This principle supports design for change, as the "secrets" that each module hides represent likely future changes. This approach is particularly valuable in the context of Dual of the Eights, where modifications to game rules, mechanics, or visual elements are likely during development and playtesting phases.

Our design follows the guidelines laid out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently, such as scoring algorithms, dice physics, or player health mechanics, should be the secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure, such as those representing dice, players, or game states, is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other module requiring information stored in a module's data structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acOS}:] Operating System: Godot makes porting the game to other operating systems simpler, but specific interfaces may have to change and testing would be required.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] Hardware: The specific hardware on which the software runs is expected to evolve, particularly as the online multiplayer functionality will require a server to enable long-distance gameplay. This aspect of the project is subject to change based on cost, performance, and scalability requirements.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUserInput}:] User Input: The format of the initial input data is expected to evolve to accommodate users in operating the game and setting game rules. These changes will be made to minimize user errors and facilitate a smoother gameplay experience.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acFileType}:] File Type: The file structure for saving game states and related data is expected to evolve. A file structure that ensures efficient storage and facilitates quick retrieval of game states is expected to be used. 
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acScoring}:] Scoring: The scoring calculations may be modified based on usability and player testing.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUI}:] User Interface (UI): A rudimentary UI is currently used for development. The UI will need to be updated to accommodate the addition of animations and will have to be refreshed in order to look more appealing once the game's major features are complete.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDice}:] Dice: Dice types can continually be added and modified as they use a simple interface and if added are simple to integrate within the larger system.
\end{description}

% \wss{Anticipated changes relate to changes that would be made in requirements, design or implementation choices.  They are not related to changes that are made at run-time, like the values of parameters.}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] Input Devices: The game is designed to play on a computer, i.e. it is designed to work with a keyboard and mouse. It is unlikely that the game will be playable through other input means such as controllers.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucOutput}:] Output Devices: The game is designed to play on a computer, i.e. it is designed to display correctly on a computer screen. It is unlikely that the game will be playable through other devices who have vastly different screen sizes such as phones.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucGames}:] Game Types: Despite being likely changes in the SRS stage of development, once formed, the game types designed would require massive module changes if they were to further be modified.
\end{description}

\newpage
\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

The modules are categorized into three types: Hardware-Hiding, Behavior-Hiding, and Software Decision modules. Below is the hierarchy:

\end{itemize}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\section{Design of Communication Protocols}

The communication protocols for this project leverage Godot's built-in multiplayer networking libraries to facilitate data synchronization and interactions between players. The design supports two key modes of communication: local area network (LAN) and online multiplayer through a server-based hosting system.

\subsection{Use of Godot Multiplayer Networking Libraries}

Godot's multiplayer networking system provides the foundation for real-time communication between players. The networking stack includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ENet Protocol:} A reliable UDP-based protocol for efficient and low-latency data transmission.
    \item \textbf{@rpc and @rpc("any\_peer") Functions:} Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) are used to synchronize state and transmit data between connected peers. The \texttt{@rpc} and \texttt{@rpc("any\_peer")} functions allow for targeted and efficient communication.
\end{itemize}

The networking manager (`networkManager2P`) is designed to handle peer-to-peer communication for two players over a LAN or via an online server. The system uses a host-client architecture, where the host player is responsible for maintaining the game state and transmitting updates to connected clients.

\subsection{Server-Based Hosting for Online Multiplayer}

For online multiplayer, a server will be implemented to host game lobbies for players who are not on the same network. The server's responsibilities include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Managing multiple lobbies and connections simultaneously.
    \item Authenticating and assigning unique identifiers to each connected player.
    \item Relaying data between the host and clients, ensuring seamless communication.
\end{itemize}

This server-based approach allows players from different locations to connect and ensures a consistent experience by maintaining a central point of synchronization for game state.

\subsection{Types of Data Passed Between Players}

The communication protocol is designed to handle various types of data to synchronize game state and ensure fair gameplay. Based on the `networkManager2P` module, the following types of data are transmitted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Game State Updates:} Includes information about the current round, dice rolls, and scores. These updates ensure both players are in sync at all times.
    \item \textbf{Player Actions:} Data related to specific player interactions, such as dice selections, re-rolls, and scoring decisions.
    \item \textbf{Customization Choices:} Information about selected customizations, such as dice face changes, passive modifiers, and consumables.
    \item \textbf{Connection Management:} Includes data for handling player connections and disconnections. This ensures smooth transitions when players join or leave a game.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functions for Data Communication}

The following functions from the `networkManager2P` module facilitate communication:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{broadcast\_disconnect(state: String, data: Dictionary)}: Calls the rpc receive\_disconnect on peers to notify.
    \item \texttt{receive\_disconnect()}: The rpc function that can be calls to receive a disconnect notification.
    \item \texttt{broadcast\_game\_state(state: String, data: Dictionary)}: Calls the rpc receive\_game\_state on peer to notify each other of game their state.
    \item \texttt{receive\_game\_state(state: String, data: Dictionary)}: The rpc function that is called to receive the other peer's game state.
    \item \texttt{ping()}: Calls itself on all connected peers to track connection status.
    \item \texttt{send\_game\_settings(\_game\_settings: Dictionary,\_hand\_settings: Dictionary)}: Calls the rpc receive\_game\_settings on peer to send the game settings to the client device.
    \item \texttt{receive\_game\_settings(\_game\_settings: Dictionary, \_hand\_settings: Dictionary)}: The rpc function that recieves the game settings from the host device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Considerations}

The communication protocols are designed with the following considerations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reliability:} The ENet protocol ensures that all critical game state data is reliably delivered to connected peers.
    \item \textbf{Low Latency:} The use of UDP minimizes delays, ensuring real-time synchronization during gameplay.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} While the current implementation supports two-player games, the architecture can be extended to handle larger multiplayer games if required.
\end{itemize}

This protocol design ensures a robust and flexible communication system for the Yahtzee game, providing a seamless multiplayer experience across both LAN and online environments.
